          <p>This photo is from around a decade ago (!), I was working as a bicycle courier in central London.</p>

      <div class="about-flex" id="about-text">
        <p>I was born in the Middle East to an Indonesian mother and English father. We moved to London when I was 3, where I have lived ever since. My dad introduced me to computers at a young age, perhaps regretably once he later found it difficult to get me away from the screen!
        </p>
        <p>For much of my working life I've been a bicycle courier – making deliveries of legal documents to urgent blood samples and everything in between. I was very keen on the potential of human powered vehicles to replace polluting van deliveries, especially in the congested streets of central London. To that end, I bought my own cargo bike (one of the first to do so) and delivered goods that would not have been possible to carry on my back, and at a speed that would never be possible in a van.
        </p>
        <p>A chance encounter on the street in 2017 led me to join e-cargobikes (ECB), a start-up that had the same idea - that vans could be replaced by cargo bikes, this time with electric assistance, for bigger supermarket food deliveries. I’ve since helped ECB to grow from a three person operation (the two founders and me!) to a company that employs over 70 riders with a fleet of exclusively electric assisted, pedal powered vehicles. Through my role at ECB my interest in IT was reignited. I've learned a lot, making a real positive impact with the use of technology to improve the company’s processes.
        </p>
        <p>Being interested in using data to inform decisions, I taught myself to use application-specific/proprietary tools – Power Query, DAX for Excel and Power Bi to process data and create dashboards, and “low code” tools such as Microsoft Power Apps, Power Automate, and Google Apps Script to connect the programs we use together and create reporting apps for my colleagues. 
        </p>
        <p>These tools were both a blessing and a curse – while I could quickly learn enough to make something to get the task I needed done, I felt like my knowledge was shallow and I am often frustrated with the limitations of a specific tool, unable to create something that really matches our requirements. This is part of why I want to learn software development – I want to understand how applications work behind the curtain, and learn the skills to build apps from the ground up, unlimited in potential to create what’s needed, and knowing how each part works as a part of the whole.
        </p>
        <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD in my mid-20’s and since then it has been a journey learning how to function, be happy, and be successful while living with the disorder. I have loads of ideas for applications that I believe could really help neurodivergent people in their day-to-day lives and I want to have learn the skills to turn those ideas into reality.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve also come to realise that it’s much easier to learn and grow in a good environment around like-minded people (not exclusive to people with ADHD) as opposed to self-directed learning. That’s a big reason why I’d like to move to a career in software development, and why I’m excited by the prospect of learning as part of a team at Founders and Coders.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of computers and cycling, my interests include rock climbing, painting and reading - especially science fiction (two of my favourite recent reads are Perdido Street Station by China Miéville, and The Pastel City by M. John Harrison).
